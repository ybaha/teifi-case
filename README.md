# Shopify Case - Yusuf

A React application built with Remix and Shopify Polaris to manage products in your Shopify store. Features include:
- Viewing products with pagination
- Creating new products with SKUs
- Deleting products 

Deleting products was an extra feature I thought would be a nice addition - and I had too much products created I wanted to delete some of them.

## Setup

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `cp .env.example .env` and add your Shopify domain and access token.
3. Run `npm run dev`
